# ðŸ§¾ FCFS Disk Scheduling in C

## ðŸ“Œ Description

The First-Come First-Serve (FCFS) algorithm processes disk requests in the order they arrive, without reordering.

# ðŸ§¾ SSTF Disk Scheduling in C

## ðŸ“Œ Description

SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First) selects the closest disk request from the current head position to minimize seek time.

# ðŸ§¾ SCAN Disk Scheduling in C

## ðŸ“Œ Description

The SCAN algorithm (Elevator Algorithm) moves the disk arm in one direction, servicing requests, then reverses at the end.

# ðŸ§¾ C-SCAN Disk Scheduling in C

## ðŸ“Œ Description

C-SCAN (Circular SCAN) services requests in one direction only and jumps to the start of the disk to continue.
