This repository contains a simple C program to implement the **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)** CPU scheduling algorithm.

## ðŸ“Œ What is FCFS?

First-Come, First-Served is the simplest CPU scheduling algorithm. The process that arrives first is served first. It's non-preemptive and works like a queue.
