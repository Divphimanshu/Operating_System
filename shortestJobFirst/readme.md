# ðŸ§  Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling in C

This repository provides a simple implementation of the **Shortest Job First (SJF)** CPU scheduling algorithm using C. It is a **non-preemptive** version that assumes all processes arrive at time 0.

## ðŸ“Œ What is SJF?

Shortest Job First (SJF) is a CPU scheduling algorithm that selects the process with the smallest execution time (burst time) to run next.

### Characteristics:
- Non-preemptive
- Optimal in reducing average waiting time for fixed arrival time
- May cause **starvation** for longer jobs
