# ðŸ§  Process Control Block (PCB) Simulation in C

This repository contains a simple simulation of a **Process Control Block (PCB)** and context switching using the C programming language.

## ðŸ“Œ What is a PCB?

A **Process Control Block (PCB)** is a data structure used by operating systems to store all information about a process. It is crucial for **process management**, **scheduling**, and **context switching**.

Each PCB typically stores:
- Process ID (PID)
- Process State (NEW, READY, RUNNING, etc.)
- Program Counter (PC)
- Memory Usage
- Priority
- Process Name
