# ðŸ”„ Round Robin Scheduling in C

This repository contains a C program to simulate the **Round Robin CPU Scheduling Algorithm**, which is a preemptive scheduling algorithm based on time slices (quantum).

## ðŸ“Œ What is Round Robin Scheduling?

Round Robin (RR) is a CPU scheduling algorithm where each process gets executed in a cyclic order for a **fixed time quantum**. If a process doesn't finish execution in its time slice, it's added back to the end of the queue.

### Features:
- **Preemptive** and fair
- Reduces starvation
- Used in **time-sharing systems**
